Postmortem Report: Web Stack Outage
Issue Summary:

Duration of Outage: June 1, 2024, 14:00 - 16:30 UTC
Impact: The e-commerce service was completely down, preventing users from browsing products or making purchases. Approximately 85% of users were affected, resulting in significant revenue loss and customer dissatisfaction.
Root Cause: A misconfigured database replication setting caused a cascading failure, leading to the primary database becoming overloaded and unresponsive.
Timeline:

14:00 - Issue detected through monitoring alert indicating high database response times.
14:05 - Initial investigation by on-call engineer confirmed the database was not responding.
14:10 - Assumption made that the issue was due to a recent application deployment.
14:20 - Rollback of the latest deployment initiated, but issue persisted.
14:30 - Database team notified and escalated to investigate potential database-specific issues.
15:00 - Database logs reviewed, revealing a high volume of replication errors.
15:15 - Network team engaged to check for potential connectivity issues.
15:30 - Misleading path investigated: potential DDoS attack considered and ruled out.
15:45 - Root cause identified: misconfiguration in database replication settings.
16:00 - Configuration corrected and database service restarted.
16:30 - Full service restored and system performance confirmed stable.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The root cause was a misconfigured setting in the database replication configuration. During a recent maintenance window, an incorrect replication delay setting was applied. This led to a buildup of unprocessed replication tasks, eventually overloading the primary database server. The increased load caused the primary database to become unresponsive, resulting in the e-commerce platform being unable to process any requests.
Resolution: To resolve the issue, the incorrect replication settings were identified and corrected. The primary database was then restarted to clear the accumulated load and reset the replication processes. Once the primary database was stable, the replication tasks were allowed to process normally, restoring full functionality to the service.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Implement stricter change management protocols for database configurations.
Enhance monitoring and alerting for database replication delays and errors.
Conduct regular audits of database settings to ensure compliance with best practices.
Tasks:

Patch Nginx Server: Update the Nginx server configuration to handle potential overload scenarios more gracefully.
Add Monitoring on Server Memory: Implement monitoring on server memory usage to detect abnormal patterns early.
Replication Settings Audit: Conduct a thorough audit of all replication settings across all database instances.
Automated Alerts: Create automated alerts specifically for replication delays and errors.
Training: Provide additional training for engineers on database management and best practices.
Documentation: Update internal documentation to include detailed procedures for database configuration changes and emergency protocols.
Redundancy Planning: Develop and implement a redundancy plan to ensure high availability in case of future database failures.
By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to reduce the likelihood of similar outages and improve our overall system reliability and resilience
