DNS Resolution:

The client (your browser) requests the IP address for www.google.com from a local DNS server.
If the local DNS server doesn’t have the record cached, it queries an authoritative DNS server.
The authoritative DNS server responds with the IP address for www.google.com.
Request Hitting Server IP on Appropriate Port:

The client sends an HTTP request to the resolved IP address on port 443 (HTTPS).
Traffic Encryption:

The HTTPS request is encrypted using SSL/TLS.
Traffic Passing Through a Firewall:

The encrypted request passes through a firewall which inspects the traffic for security purposes.
Load Balancer:

The request reaches a load balancer, which distributes the traffic among multiple web servers to ensure reliability and performance.
Web Server Serving the Web Page:

The load balancer forwards the request to an appropriate web server.
Application Server Generating the Web Page:

The web server communicates with an application server to generate the dynamic content of the web page.
Database Request:

The application server queries a database to fetch any required data to generate the web page content.
Response Back to Client:

The web server sends the generated web page back to the client over the encrypted HTTPS connection.
Here’s a diagram to illustrate this flow:


Detailed Diagram Description:
DNS Resolution:

Client → Local DNS Server → Authoritative DNS Server → Local DNS Server → Client
Request Hitting Server IP on Appropriate Port:

Client → HTTPS request to IP on port 443
Traffic Encryption:

HTTPS (encrypted with SSL/TLS)
Traffic Passing Through a Firewall:

Encrypted request → Firewall → Load Balancer
Load Balancer:

Load Balancer → Multiple Web Servers
Web Server Serving the Web Page:

Load Balancer → Chosen Web Server
Application Server Generating the Web Page:

Web Server → Application Server
Database Request:

Application Server → Database Server → Application Server
Response Back to Client:

Web Server → Client (over HTTPS)
